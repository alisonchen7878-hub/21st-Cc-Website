        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Alison Chen is a violinist, violist, educator, and entrepreneur who
          believes in music’s power to build connection and spark change. Her
          career has taken her from the stage to classrooms and communities
          across the world, where she has used music as a tool for healing,
          learning, and empowerment.
        </p>
        <p>
          As both a performer and teacher, Alison has worked with diverse
          communities, including leading music therapy workshops in Africa and
          teaching in underprivileged communities in Brazil through her
          company, Readysetgo Music. Her entrepreneurial path reflects the
          same creativity she brings to her artistry: designing programs that
          meet community needs, managing teams, and building projects that make
          a tangible difference. These experiences deepened her understanding
          of music’s role beyond performance halls—it can be a source of
          resilience, creativity, and belonging. She carries this vision into
          every project she undertakes.
        </p>
        <p>
          On stage, Alison has been recognized with first prizes at the
          Princeton University Pitch Competition and Ivey Pitch Competition
          for her work as an entrepreneur. She has performed across North
          America as a soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral player,
          exploring repertoire that spans classical traditions and contemporary
          works. Her work as a conductor—self-taught through dedication and
          mentorship—has allowed her to lead ensembles and refine her ability
          to inspire collaboration through clear vision and communication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently completing a dual degree at Western University in Business
          and Music, Alison continues to bridge the two disciplines, shaping a
          career that integrates performance, teaching, and innovation. She is
          passionate about developing projects that connect music to broader
          communities, especially in ways that expand access and bring people
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking ahead, Alison hopes to continue performing while building
          arts initiatives that center on education, accessibility, and social
          impact. Whether on stage or in the community, her work is guided by
          the belief that music has the power to transform lives.
