      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>
        Alison Chen is a violinist, violist, educator, and entrepreneur who
        believes in music’s power to build connection and spark change. Her
        career has taken her from the stage to classrooms and communities across
        the world, where she has used music as a tool for healing, learning, and
        empowerment.
      </p>

      <p>
        As both a performer and teacher, Alison has worked with diverse
        communities, including leading music therapy workshops in Africa and
        teaching in underprivileged communities in Brazil through her company,
        Readysetgo Music. Her entrepreneurial path reflects the same creativity
        she brings to her artistry: designing programs that meet community
        needs, managing teams, and building projects that make a tangible
        difference. These experiences deepened her understanding of music’s
        role beyond performance halls—it can be a source of resilience,
        creativity, and belonging. She carries this vision into every project
        she undertakes.
      </p>

      <p>
        On stage, Alison has been recognized with first prizes at the Princeton
        University Pitch Competition and Ivey Pitch Competition for her work as
        an entrepreneur. She has performed across North America as a soloist,
        chamber musician, and orchestral player, exploring repertoire that spans
        classical traditions and contemporary works. Her work as a conductor— 
        self-taught through dedication and mentorship—has allowed her to lead
        ensembles and refine her ability to inspire collaboration through clear
        vision and communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently completing a dual degree at Western University in Business and
        Music, Alison continues to bridge the two disciplines, shaping a career
        that integrates performance, teaching, and innovation. She is
        passionate about developing projects that connect music to broader
        communities, especially in ways that expand access and bring people
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead, Alison hopes to continue performing while building arts
        initiatives that center on education, accessibility, and social impact.
        Whether on stage or in the community, her work is guided by the belief
        that music has the power to transform lives.

        ages and levels, from absolute beginners to advanced performers
        preparing for examinations, auditions, and professional training
        pathways.

          <h3>Studio Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Alison teaches students from Beginner through ARCT level and works
            with children, teens, and adults. Her studio welcomes students with
            a wide range of goals, including recreational learning, RCM
            examination preparation, school music programs, youth orchestras,
            chamber music, and pre-university training.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lessons are offered both in-person in the Greater Toronto Area and
            online, providing flexible access for families with busy schedules
            or students learning from outside the region. Alison prioritizes
            creating a supportive, structured, and encouraging learning
            environment for every student.
          </p>

          <p>
            Drawing from her experiences leading music therapy workshops in
            Africa and teaching in underprivileged communities in Brazil through
            Readysetgo Music, Alison brings a strong emphasis on accessibility,
            confidence-building, and the social impact of music education into
            her teaching practice.

          <h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Building a strong technical foundation with healthy, sustainable playing habits</li>
            <li>Developing a beautiful, controlled tone and musical phrasing</li>
            <li>Teaching students how to practice effectively and independently</li>
            <li>Preparing students for RCM exams, auditions, competitions, and performances</li>
            <li>Encouraging confidence, creativity, and expressive musicianship</li>
            <li>Supporting long-term growth rather than short-term results</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Lesson Format</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Weekly private lessons (30, 45, or 60 minutes)</li>
            <li>In-person lessons in the GTA or live online instruction</li>
            <li>Customized practice plans and goal-setting for each student</li>
            <li>Performance coaching and mock exam preparation</li>
            <li>Guidance on repertoire selection and technical studies</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Alison believes that every student’s musical journey is unique. Her
            goal is not only to help students improve technically, but also to
            help them develop confidence, discipline, and a lifelong connection
            to music.
