        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>
          Alison Chen is a violinist, violist, educator, and entrepreneur who
          believes in music’s power to build connection and spark change. Her
          career has taken her from the stage to classrooms and communities
          across the world, where she has used music as a tool for healing,
          learning, and empowerment.
        </p>

        <p>
          As both a performer and teacher, Alison has worked with diverse
          communities, including leading music therapy workshops in Africa and
          teaching in underprivileged communities in Brazil through her
          company, Readysetgo Music. Her entrepreneurial path reflects the
          same creativity she brings to her artistry: designing programs that
          meet community needs, managing teams, and building projects that make
          a tangible difference.
        </p>

        <p>
          On stage, Alison has been recognized with first prizes at the
          Princeton University Pitch Competition and Ivey Pitch Competition.
          She has performed across North America as a soloist, chamber musician,
          and orchestral player.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently completing a dual degree at Western University in Business
          and Music, Alison continues to bridge the two disciplines.
